Sunrise Glitch Games is a collective of game developers, artists, musicians and sound designers collaborating on innovative indie games, brought together by a shared passion of game development and retro gaming.

We build our games using an open source technology stack, including:
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)
- [Blender](https://blender.org)
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org)
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)
- [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org)

Tools that are developed while working on our games will be open sourced where possible. We believe in creating and supporting a community, to build many more awesome games in the future.
